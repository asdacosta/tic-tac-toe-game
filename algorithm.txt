Problem
Tic tac toe game for two players and against AI with different levels of difficulty.


Algorithm
Create a module for 'Duo' selection
1. Set an prompt to take name of both players
    - At page load and a click on 'Restart' button.
2. Select players elements with PLAYER1 and PLAYER2
    - Let their content be the values from the alert
3. Select scores elements with SCORE1 and SCORE2
4. Select game buttons with GAMEBUTTONS variable
6. Use for-each to loop over GAMEBUTTONS
    - Add click event to all buttons
        * First click should have a content of 'X'
        * Second click should have a content of 'O'
        * Alternate


Pseudo-code
1. 
    CONST select = get('select');
    CONST restartButton = get('section + button');
    CONST gameButtons = getAll('.real-box > button');

    CONST score1 = get('.score1');
    CONST score2 = get('.score2');

    restartButton.ADDEVENTLISTENER('CLICK', () => {
        duo.takeNames();
    })
2. 
    CONST duo = (FXN () {
        FXN takeNames () {
        CONST player1 = get('.player1');
        CONST player2 = get('.player2');

        IF (option.value is 'friend')
            player1.TEXTCONTENT = PROMPT('Enter first player name:')
            player2.TEXTCONTENT = PROMPT('Enter second player name:)
        END-IF
        }
        EDN-FXN

        select.ADDEVENTLISTENER('CHANGE', () => {
            takeNames();
        })

        LET currentPick = 'X';
        gameButtons.FOREACH(button, () => {
            button.ADDEVENTLISTENER('CLICK', () => {
                IF (!button.TEXTCONTENT)
                    button.TEXTCONTENT = currentPick;
                    currentPick = currentPick === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
                END-IF
            })
        })

    })()

Tic tac toe game for two players and against AI with different levels of difficulty.


Algorithm
Create a module for 'Duo' selection
1. Set an prompt to take name of both players
    - At page load and a click on 'Restart' button.
2. Select players elements with PLAYER1 and PLAYER2
    - Let their content be the values from the alert
3. Select scores elements with SCORE1 and score2


Pseudo-code
1. 
    CONST duoOption = get('.duo');
    CONST restartButton = get('section + button');
2. 
    duoOption.ADDEVENTLISTENER('click', (() => {
        CONST player1 = get('.player1');
        CONST player2 = get('.player2');

        player1.TEXTCONTENT = Use prompt to take player 1 name
        player2.TEXTCONTENT = Use prompt to take player 2 name

        restartButton.ADDEVENTLISTENER('click', () => {
            CONST player1 = Use prompt to take player 1 name
            CONST player2 = Use prompt to take player 2 name
        })

        CONST score1 = get('.score1');
        CONST score2 = get('.score2');
    })())
